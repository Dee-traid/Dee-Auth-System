🚀 Installation Guide
1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

XAMPP (PHP 8.0+ enabled)

PostgreSQL

Composer (globally installed)

2️⃣ Clone or Move Project
git clone https://github.com/Dee-Traid/Dee-Auth-System.git
3️⃣ Install Dependencies

From the project root directory:

composer install

This will install:

PHPMailer

PHP DotEnv

🗄 Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database named:

user_auth

Then execute:

CREATE TABLE user_auth (
    id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    fullname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
⚙ Environment Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=user_auth
DB_USER=your_postgres_user
DB_PASS=your_postgres_password

MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASS=your_app_password
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Auto Triad Auth"

⚠️ Important:
Never commit your .env file to version control. Add it to .gitignore.

▶ Running the Application

Start Apache via XAMPP.

Ensure PostgreSQL is running.

Visit:

http://localhost/Dee/App.php

You should now be able to:

Register

Log in

Recover password

Access dashboard
